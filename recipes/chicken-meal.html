  <h2>Pan-Seared Chicken</h2>

  <p>This recipe is very simple (as all my recipes are) yet tasty. I don't think you can even call these recipes. Anyways. This is pan-seared chicken.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul class="ingredients">
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Spice mixture (salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol class="steps">
    <li>Coat chicken in spice mixture. Add cayenne relative to your spice level</li>
    <li>Put stove on medium heat for ~1.5-2 minutes. Temperature of oil should be around 250-300 degrees if you can measure it.</li>
    <li>Fry in oil for about 4 minutes on each side. Don't touch the chicken while it's cooking to ensure a nice sear</li>
  </ol>
